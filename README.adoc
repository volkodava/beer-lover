= beer-lover

beer-lover application aims to solve programmer's problem with a drinks.

= Requirements
A programmer drinks exactly goalPints of beer every evening. 
One evening, the programmer opens his fridge and sees a number of smallBottles of beer (1 pint each) and  a number of bigBottles of beer (3 pints each). 
The programmer needs to decide whether he can pick some bottles and start drinking, or has to run to the store to buy some more bottles. 
The programmer is "greedy" and never consumes a bottle partially. 

Write a Java-method which returns true if it is possible to make the goal by choosing from the given (whole) bottles, or false otherwise. 
Note that it is not necessary to "take" all bottles â€” some may remain unused.

    public boolean gotBeer(int goalPints, int smallBottles, int bigBottles) {
      // TODO: implement me
    }

  Examples: 
    gotBeer(6, 3, 1)  must return  true
    gotBeer(7, 3, 1)  must return  false
    gotBeer(6, 3, 2)  must return  true
    gotBeer(3, 0, 1)  must return  	true
    gotBeer(1, 0, 1)  must return  false

package com.smartling;

import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo;
import org.junit.Test;

public class ProgrammerTest {

    @Test
    public void gotBeerAcceptanceTest() {
        // create a programmer
        Programmer programmer = new Programmer();
        boolean gotBeer;

        // must return true
        gotBeer = programmer.gotBeer(6, 3, 1);
        assertThat(gotBeer, equalTo(true));

        // must return false
        gotBeer = programmer.gotBeer(7, 3, 1);
        assertThat(gotBeer, equalTo(false));

        // must return true
        gotBeer = programmer.gotBeer(6, 3, 2);
        assertThat(gotBeer, equalTo(true));

        // must return true
        gotBeer = programmer.gotBeer(3, 0, 1);
        assertThat(gotBeer, equalTo(true));

        // must return false 
        gotBeer = programmer.gotBeer(1, 0, 1);
        assertThat(gotBeer, equalTo(false));

        // must return true 
        gotBeer = programmer.gotBeer(0, 0, 1);
        assertThat(gotBeer, equalTo(true));
    }
